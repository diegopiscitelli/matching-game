# moydo-game
Memory game to test programming skills.
## Comments
Here is a Figma Jam which I use to plan the development:<br>

Although is not exactly how it was developed, it helped me to get a starting point.

## Main "Nice to have" and improvements I would like to do:<br>
-I would include a clock to impulse users to get a better score. Then we could create a record history and save it in the local storage.<br>
-The responsiveness and accesibility could be better.
<br>
-I should improve the reset game function to avoid new images to be displayed before the flip animation is done.
<br>
-Sounds and animations for game events.

Requirements missing: <br>
-Use of Bootstrap5
